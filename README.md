## 🔖 Description

Studying how to envolve websites with a global event-ready data object.

## 🎓 Tech

Vanilla JavaScript.

## 📖 How To

There are two `scripts` in the project: `customEvent.js` and `customEventWithData.js`.

First one declares an Event called **_myHappyCustomEvent_** which is dispatched on every click in DOM.

Second one declares en Event called **_withCustomData_** which is dispatched on every click in the button. This event owns custom data set in `detail` property (check console to find it).
